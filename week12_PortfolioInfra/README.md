# üìà Week 12: High-Frequency Trading Portfolio Infrastructure

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project implements a **high-performance trading engine infrastructure** featuring:
- **Multi-client Gateway** using **ZeroMQ ROUTER/DEALER** pattern  
- **Lock-free Order Queue** for efficient order passing  
- **Multi-threaded Worker Pool** for order processing  
- **Optimized Matching Engine** with per-symbol OrderBooks  
- **Latency Monitoring** and **Portfolio PnL Tracking**  
- **Market Feed** for backtesting or live simulation (can be disabled with `--no-feed`)

This is the **final milestone** for the Week 12 project, successfully completing the HFT Portfolio Infrastructure module.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Gateway (Multi-Client Order Ingress)
- Supports **multiple clients** concurrently via **ZeroMQ ROUTER**.
- Each client has a unique identity ‚Üí orders are routed correctly.
- ACK responses are correctly sent back to each client.

### ‚úÖ Worker Pool (Parallel Processing)
- Backend uses a **DEALER socket** bound to `inproc://yuming_slaves`.
- Multiple worker threads **connect** to this endpoint.
- Workers receive `[identity][payload]`, parse orders, and send ACKs back with identity.

### ‚úÖ Matching Engine
- Per-symbol OrderBook (`OrderBookOptimized`) supporting limit order matching.
- Matching logic follows **price-time priority**.
- Generates trades (`[TRADE] buy=... sell=... sym=... px=... qty=...`).

### ‚úÖ Market Feed (Replay & Simulation)
- Reads historical CSV (minute bars) and generates simulated orders.
- Can be disabled with the `--no-feed` flag for clean client testing.

### ‚úÖ Portfolio Management
- Tracks **PnL per symbol**.
- Outputs CSV with final portfolio state.

### ‚úÖ Latency Monitoring
- Captures and logs **per-match latency** and **per-symbol latency**.

## üß© How the ZeroMQ Gateway Works

### Message Flow
1. **Client DEALER** ‚Üí sends `[ORDER|...]` with its identity (`C1`).
2. **ROUTER Frontend** ‚Üí preserves identity and forwards to Backend DEALER.
3. **Worker DEALER** ‚Üí receives `[identity][payload]`, processes payload, pushes to order queue, and returns `[identity][ACK]`.
4. **ROUTER** ‚Üí routes ACK back to the correct client.

## ‚úÖ Key Technical Decisions
- **ROUTER/DEALER** ‚Üí Enables multi-client, multi-worker non-blocking communication.
- **LockFree RingBuffer** ‚Üí Low latency, thread-safe order passing.
- **Per-symbol OrderBook** ‚Üí Supports concurrent matching across multiple instruments.
- **Modular Design** ‚Üí Ready for expansion (Market Data Broadcaster, Web UI, etc.).

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- **Gateway Ports**  
  - The Gateway binds to `tcp://*:8787` (or your configured port).  
  - Use `lsof -i :8787` to check if the port is already in use.  
  - If `Address already in use` occurs, kill any leftover process with `kill -9 <PID>`.

- **Worker Identity Handling**  
  - Workers must **receive two frames**: `[identity][payload]`.  
  - They must **send back the identity frame** with ACK to allow proper client routing.  
  - This follows the ZeroMQ ROUTER/DEALER message pattern.

- **Market Feed Control**  
  - Use the flag `--no-feed` to disable simulated market data during testing.  
  - This is useful for clean Gateway ‚Üí Worker ‚Üí Engine multi-client testing.

- **Testing Order Matching**  
  - Python demo generates random buy/sell orders to trigger trades.  
  - Engine logs `[TRADE]` only when matching occurs (buy price ‚â• sell price).  

- **Performance Considerations**  
  - Lock-free ring buffer minimizes contention in order passing.  
  - The system supports scaling with multiple worker threads to handle high load.

## üî• Next Steps (Mini Exchange Roadmap)
- Add **Market Data Broadcaster** (ZeroMQ PUB/SUB).
- Implement **WebSocket Dashboard** to visualize live OrderBook.
- Introduce **Risk Engine** (order validation & throttling).
- Add **Persistence Layer** (TimescaleDB or PostgreSQL for trade history).
